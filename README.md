This would be helpful for starting on your own discord bot

The steps to start are:

1.Install Visual Studio Code and NodeJS

2.Create a folder

3.Write ```cmd``` on the up bar that says *C:\Users\Tutorial\DiscordBot* and press enter

4.After that you see a command prompt so what you need to do is to create a package.json by typing npm innit and follow its steps

5.You need to install discord.js by typing ```npm i discord.js```



There you go.

If you want to code like ping command or something view index.js on this repository

Sincerely,
CODER
